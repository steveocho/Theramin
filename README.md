# Theremin
**About**

This repository gathers together current open source information concerning audio amplification, arduino programming of serial input and output, and sensor analysis into a fun project that imitates a Theremin but with more ease of use.

We hope to see it expanded on and possibly made into a product that can be enjoyed inside and outside of the open source community.

**Parts List**

* Capacitors (x2) - 1 uF each
* Resistor (x3)
* MOSFET (2N7000)
* Arduino Microcontroller (Uno)
